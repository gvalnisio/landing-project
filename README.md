# Personal Hub / Landing Page

### Motivation
This was a quick project idea to show my skills with React and JavaScript, by using Bootstrap, hooks and APIs.

### To-do List
This section is a simple to-do list, where you can click on the items that you've already completed to cross them. You can enter an item by clicking the button beside the input box or by clicking "Enter".

### Weather Widget
This section gets the user location by the Geolocation API in the browser and shows the weather from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/), as well as the humidity and the wind speed.

### Cat Facts
This section uses a [Random Cat Facts API](https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/#/) to show funny little cat facts to the user.

### Calendar
This section is just a simple calendar, created using the Calendar library on React.
